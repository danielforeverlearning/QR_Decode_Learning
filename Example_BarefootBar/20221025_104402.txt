mask == white black white

(1) 2025aug29 ok so Wikipedia is same as
    QR_Format_Information.svg if-and-only-if black is defined as 0.
	  But i made
	  original_map.txt and original_map_2.txt as black is 1.
	  And using mask ((i*j)%3+i+j)%2 == 0
	  And assuming your code is correct
	  And assuming codewords go up from bottom-right
	  you did NOT get h t t p s
    104 116 116 112 115
    And stepped thru debugger at https://webqr.com/

(2) Ok transform original_map_2.txt to original_map_3_black0.txt
    and then try again with mask ((i*j)%3+i+j)%2 == 0
	ok ..... this did not work you gotta watch whole video to learn
	and you also got to understand "version" you did not go that far in video.
	
	this is from old readme which i deleted:
	
	learning how to decode a QR code
    Sorry not done getting codewords, 
    stepping thru zxing-ported-to-javascript-code-from-github-jsqrcode in web-browser debugger 
	decoder.js line 41 breakpoint seems 
	mycodeword[0]  == codewordBytes[0] 
	mycodeword[4]  == codewordBytes[1] 
	mycodeword[8]  == codewordBytes[2] 
	mycodeword[12] == codewordBytes[3] 
	mycodeword[16] == codewordBytes[4] 
	but then have to fix code that gets codewords
	
(3)	Downloads folder contains:
	jsqrcode-master
	
	uploading folder 
	jsqrcode-master
	
	or just step thru https://webqr.com/
		
(4) there are dynamic vs static qrcodes, 
    dynamic is a short-url that redirects,
	static is the url string no redirect.
    this example is version6 41x41
    but it has colorful-brand-logo in middle with CTA (call to action)
    you will have to learn error-correction and qrcode generation/encoding first
    for now since you are learning its best to stick with simpler
    black and white only qrcodes say version 6 or less
    before learning more complex qrcodes,
    again have to learn error-correction and colors CTA.
	
(5) 2025sept1 ok it is original_map_2.txt and mask5.txt 
	after getting D bytes in correct sequential order, look at
    The-structure-for-QR-code-of-version-6-with-error-correction-level-medium-figure-is.png
	Made 20221025_104402_codewords.txt from debugger stepping thru https://webqr.com/
	Wrote function Decode_Correct_Sequential_Codewords
	so it is a static QR code NOT a dynamic QR code.
